# Restful-Booker API Test Automation

This repository contains an automated test suite for the [Restful-Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com). It covers functional, integration, negative, and performance testing for key endpoints including `GET /booking`, `PATCH /booking/{id}`, and `DELETE /booking/{id}`.

---

## Overview

This project verifies the correctness, reliability, and performance of the Restful-Booker API using automated regression tests. It includes:
- End-to-end API testing
- Data-driven and negative test cases
- CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions
- Allure reporting for results and trends

---

## Technologies Used

- **Java** (Test Language)
- **JUnit** (Test Framework)
- **RestAssured** (HTTP Client for API Testing)
- **Maven** (Build Tool)
- **Allure** (Test Reporting)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD)
- **SLF4J** (Logging)

## Whatâ€™s Tested

### GET /booking
- Retrieve all booking IDs
- Filter by `firstname`, `lastname`, `checkin`, `checkout`
- Combined filters
- Invalid parameters
- Response structure and timing

### PATCH /booking/{id}
- Single and multiple field updates
- Nested `bookingdates` update
- Invalid ID, missing token, invalid data formats
- Idempotent behavior

### DELETE /booking/{id}
- Valid and invalid deletions
- Deletion verification (404 on GET)
- Token-based auth validation
- Concurrency tests
